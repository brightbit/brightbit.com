We doubled our headcount and shipped a lot of code in 2013. Looking ahead to
2014, we’re hoping for an even bigger and better year for Brightbit. To help
kick things off, we are starting a referral program.

## How It Works
If you refer any project to us that we take on as a client, we will pay you 5%
of the payment we receive. *That means you get 5% every time we get a payment*,
for the *entire lifetime* of the project.

## The Kind of Projects We Look For
We specialize in building high-complexity web and mobile applications that are
custom-built to client specifications. We’re not afraid of taking on the hard
stuff that other shops avoid. We do a variety of complex custom programming for
startups, businesses, and ourselves including internal products, e-commerce
platforms, APIs, mobile websites, mobile apps for iPhone and Android - nearly
anything you can think of that's beyond basic websites.

## Get In Touch
If you have a lead for us, send an email to <a
href="mailto:hello@brightbit.com">hello@brightbit.com</a> with information on
the project and who to contact, or better yet - give us a warm introduction.
You can have confidence that the project is in good hands, and you can have a
little extra cash in your pocket for being so awesome.
