Our good friends at the Oklahoma City Coworking Collaborative ([OKCCoCo](http://okccoco.org)) are moving to a new location! That means Brightbit was going to be without a home while they secure a new space, and at the last minute we were invited to set up our new office at The Exhange, just a few blocks away in the Arts District in downtown Oklahoma City.

The new office is in the beautiful historic Film Exchange building on Film Row, one of the iconic brick buildings downtown. [Venture Spur](http://http://venturespur.com/) is one of our neighbors, and their startup accelerator starts up in August so we look forward to being around the excitement.
