Fantasy Sports just got a lot less painful. Fourward Labs teamed up with Brightbit to launch [SportsVault](http://sportsvault.net), a league payment and communication app.

About 10% of fantasy leagues don't get paid out at the end of the season due to bad communication and questionable commissioners. SportsVault aims to help make sure that fantasy sports leagues stay active and team owners feel secure.
