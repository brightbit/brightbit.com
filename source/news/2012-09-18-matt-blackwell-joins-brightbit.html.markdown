We would like to welcome Matt Blackwell to the Brightbit team as our new
Sales and Business Operations Manager. Matt comes to us with over 3
years of experience in Sales, Project Management, and Business
Operations as the COO at his previous employer.

Matt's focus will be helping us grow as a full-service web and mobile
development studio by handling all the sales and day-to-day business
operations work, allowing us to focus more on creating awesome things
for our customers. We look forward to a great 2013 with Matt on board
(assuming the apocalypse doesn't come).
