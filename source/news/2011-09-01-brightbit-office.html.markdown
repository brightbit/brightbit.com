[Brightbit](http://brightb.it) has been a company since 2010 for all of us (Vance, Eric, and Joshua) to work on our own projects together (like [Kikuchat](http://kikuchat.com) and [Keynot.es](http://keynot.es)), but now that half of 2011 has elapsed, we have made the leap and are now officially all fulltime self-employed partners in Brightbit. We are taking client work doing web sites, web applications, mobile applications, REST APIs, and basically anything interactive that has to do with the internet.

I’m not sure what it is about getting an office, but it makes thing seem more real to actually have a dedicated place of doing business. It somehow legitimizes your business for both you and your customers. Keeping expenses low is a concern, but it’s important to start things off in the right frame of mind. Fortunately, we were able to keep both concerns in check by getting a private office at the [OKC Coworking Collaborative](http://okccoco.com) - a local tech-focused co-working space with good rates and great company. We pay a single monthly rate that covers the office, internet, electricity, and even coffee. It’s a great place to start a business that doesn’t require applications or approval like incubators. Come check us out if you’re in the area. We have a flexible schedule and we work from home sometimes, but there’s always at least one of us in the office on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
