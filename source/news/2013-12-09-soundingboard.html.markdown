Ever since Apple released the iPhone and App Store, people have been dreaming
up app ideas they imagine will conjure up massive popularity and large sums of
money. It's an easy and sexy dream to buy into for anyone, especially for
people who have little to no technical knowledge. And for every wildly
successful application, there are thousands of apps that don't even reach break
even. How can you know if your idea is worth the effort? And even if it's the
best idea in the world, where do you start?

### Talking to a "Computer Person"

If you're lucky enough to know a programmer or someone that possess technical
knowledge in building apps (i.e. a “computer person”), you could share your
killer app idea with them and solicit their feedback. *Oh, great* - thinks the
computer person - *here's yet another idea I have to listen to while pretending
to care*. The conversation is already setup for failure. The computer person's
primary incentive is to end the conversation as quickly as possible unless they
consider you a friend. <mark>At best, the computer person will give you a
superficial, shallow, and/or narrow validation that you are likely to put too
much stock in</mark>. At worst, the computer person will tell you exactly how much
your idea sucks while wearing the smug grin of superiority, knowing that he
would never dream up something so dumb and obviously flawed.

### Talking to a Development Studio

If you are a little more serious about your app idea beyond casual
conversations, you can find a development studio and get an estimate for how
much time and money it would take to build. But which studio do you choose?
There are thousands of studios you could contact. Your experience will vary
wildly between studios because each have their own technical specialities and
preferences and <mark>their primary incentive is to win your business</mark>. By attempting
to validate your idea with a studio that is primarily concerned with “winning”
your business and building the app, you take the risk of being sold on
something that best suits their strengths and preferences, not necessarily the
best solution for your idea. There's also the chance <mark>they might not warn you of
potential risks</mark>, either because they don't recognize them (especially if you
 only talk with sales people and not developers), or, if they are less
reputable, because they want the work enough to omit those details. Studios are
also generally not concerned with how well suited your app idea is for the
marketplace, so you can't expect market analysis, competitive research, ways to
differentiate your idea from competition, ideas for improvement, etc.

### A Better First Step

There is clearly opportunity here for a better first-step - <mark>a way to align
incentives</mark> between people who are serious about their app idea and people who
are knowledgeable about how to build apps and online businesses. This is where
[SoundingBoard.tv](https://soundingboard.tv) comes in. Sounding Board is a pre-paid one-hour consultation
over Skype with an experienced developer who also knows the business of
building apps. After your consultation, you will receive a written report
containing the app idea analysis, additional insights, and follow-up
information. The feedback you receive is impartial, technical, comprehensive,
  and since it's already paid for, <mark>absent of pressure to sell you a particular
  product or service</mark>. We don't solicit work or upsell and your idea stays
  private. You can share your report with anyone you like, and even take it to
  development shops to get more accurate quotes once you're ready to proceed
  with building your app.

So if you have an idea for an app and don't know where to start, give
