We welcome Jonathan Camenisch to the Brightbit team as our first
developer/programmer hire. Jonathan has over 3 years of experience
building Ruby apps small and large ranging from Sinatra to Rails, with
the ability to handle programming on the backend as well as frontend
skills to put it all together.

Jonathan joins us after spending a good amount of time freelancing, and
we're anxious for him to put his self-motivatied work ethic and
entrepreneurial skills to use for us and our clients.
